    <h1>My Melody</h1>
    <p>
      My Melody (マイメロディ, Mai Merodī), frequently known for short as My
      Melo (マイメロ Mai Mero), Hello Kitty‘s best friend, is a white rabbit
      from the Japanese characterization company Sanrio. When she debuted, she
      was portraying Little Red Riding Hood in her version of the classic fairy
      tale. That is why she wears a red (or pink) hood that covers her ears,
      often having a bow or a flower on her right side. She is a very honest,
      good-natured girl. Her favorite food is almond pound cake. She was born on
      January 18th in the magical forest of Mariland located in London, the home
      to many of her friends. Although she is often pictured with Kuromi as
      friends, they are rivals. My melody also bleeds out strawberry jam.
