      <p>
        My Melody (マイメロディ, Mai Merodī), frequently known for short as My
        Melo (マイメロ Mai Mero), Hello Kitty‘s best friend, is a white rabbit
        from the Japanese characterization company Sanrio. When she debuted, she
        was portraying Little Red Riding Hood in her version of the classic
        fairy tale. That is why she wears a red (or pink) hood that covers her
        ears, often having a bow or a flower on her right side. She is a very
        honest, good-natured girl. Her favorite food is almond pound cake. She
        was born on January 18th in the magical forest of Mariland located in
        London, the home to many of her friends. Although she is often pictured
        with Kuromi as friends, they are rivals. My melody also bleeds out
        strawberry jam.
